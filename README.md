AIM-To learn diffrent types of datatypes in C++

APPARATUS-Programiz/VS code

ALGORITHM:


Include the standard input/output library.

Enable use of standard namespace for simplified name access.

Start the main program.

For each data type (integer, string, float, character, boolean):

Declare a variable of the respective type.

Display the memory size of the variable in bytes.

End the program with a successful return status.

THEORY:
In C++, fundamental data types are the basic, built-in types provided by the language to store simple kinds of data. They are not derived from other types and are directly supported by the compiler. Below is a concise overview of the fundamental data types:

Integer Types (for whole numbers):
int: Standard integer (e.g., 42, -10). Typically 4 bytes.
short: Smaller integer. Typically 2 bytes.
long: Larger integer. At least 4 bytes.
long long: Even larger integer. At least 8 bytes.
Modifiers: signed (default, allows negative) or unsigned (non-negative).

Floating-Point Types (for decimal numbers):
float: Single-precision floating-point (e.g., 3.14). Typically 4 bytes.
double: Double-precision floating-point (e.g., 3.14159). Typically 8 bytes.
long double: Extended-precision floating-point. Size varies (often 8 or 16 bytes).

Character Types (for characters):
char: Single character (e.g., 'A', '5'). Exactly 1 byte.
wchar_t: Wide character for extended character sets (e.g., Unicode). Size varies.

Boolean Type (for true/false):
bool: Stores true or false. Typically 1 byte.

Void Type:
void: Represents the absence of a type, used in functions (e.g., no return value) or pointers.

Sizeof Operator:In C++, the sizeof operator is a compile-time unary operator that returns the size, in bytes, of a variable, data type, or expression. It is used to determine the amount of memory allocated for a given type or object on a specific system

Syntax:sizeof()

CONCLUSION:

Here we learn about diffrent datatypes in c++.We also learn what is their size(memory consumed).
