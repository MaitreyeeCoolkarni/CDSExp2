This code is to determine how much memory is used up by diffrent data types

Fundamental Data Types in C++
int 
Definition: Represents whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero) without decimal points.
Size: 4 bytes 

float 
Definition: Represents single-precision floating-point numbers with decimal points, suitable for approximate calculations.
Size: 4 bytes 

double 
Definition: Represents double-precision floating-point numbers with higher precision than float, used for more accurate decimal calculations.
Size: 8 bytes

char (Character)
Definition: Represents a single character (e.g., letters, digits, or symbols) using the ASCII or extended character set.
Size: 1 byte 

bool (Boolean)
Definition: Represents a logical value, either true or false.
Size: 1 byte 

Conclusion -- C++ have diffrent data types which have diffrent sizes
